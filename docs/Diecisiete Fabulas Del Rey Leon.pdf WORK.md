Diecisiete Fabulas Del Rey Leon (Seventeen Fables of the Lion King) is a book by Jean Muzi, a French author who was born in Casablanca, Morocco. The book contains short stories that feature a lion as the main character, but not the typical lion that we know as the king of the jungle. Instead, these fables show a lion that is fearful, cowardly, and ridiculed by other animals, such as the jackal, the hyena, the camel, the goat, and so on. These stories demonstrate that strength and power are not always enough to overcome obstacles.
 
The fables in this book come from different continents and cultures, such as Africa, Asia, Europe, and America. They invite the readers to reflect on the weakness of the powerful and the wisdom of the humble. The book also has beautiful illustrations that complement the stories.

The lion thought that it was another lion with a hare in his mouth, and he jumped into the well to fight him. The moral of the story is that cunning can overcome strength.

A third fable in the book is called "The Lion and the Mouse". It illustrates how a small mouse saved a lion from a hunter's trap. The mouse was wandering in the forest when he saw a lion sleeping under a tree. He decided to have some fun by tickling the lion's nose with his tail. The lion woke up and caught the mouse in his paw. He was about to eat him when the mouse begged for mercy. He said that he could be useful to the lion someday, if he let him go. The lion laughed at this idea, but he let the mouse go anyway. Later, the lion was caught in a net by a hunter. He roared for help, and the mouse heard him. He ran to the net and gnawed at it until he freed the lion. The moral of the story is that no act of kindness is ever wasted.
